        "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that allows for the organization and structuring of code in a way that models real-world objects and their interactions. OOP focuses on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes, and provides a set of principles and techniques to design and implement software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main objectives of OOP include:\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity: OOP promotes modularity by encapsulating data and behavior into objects. This allows for the creation of reusable and self-contained units of code, making it easier to manage and maintain complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: OOP encourages abstraction by defining classes that represent general concepts and hiding the underlying implementation details. This allows programmers to work at a higher level of abstraction, focusing on the essential features of an object rather than its internal workings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: OOP supports inheritance, which enables the creation of new classes based on existing ones. Inheritance facilitates code reuse and promotes the organization of classes into hierarchies, where subclasses inherit characteristics from their parent classes while adding or modifying their own.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: OOP facilitates polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility in code, as it allows for the creation of code that can operate on objects of different types without needing to know their specific classes."
